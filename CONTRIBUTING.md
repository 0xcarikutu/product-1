## Setting up Jekyll

### Ubuntu
* Jekyll requires Ruby, which should be already be installed
* `sudo apt-get install ruby-dev`
* `sudo gem install bundler`
* Clone this repo and navigate to its root
* `bundle install` (installs Jekyll locally)
* run the site locally with: `bundle exec jekyll serve` (also rebuilds the site as you make changes)
